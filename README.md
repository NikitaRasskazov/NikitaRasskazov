I'm beginner Python developer.
----------------

I'm a backend developer who's been focusing on server management and web development. I've spent time learning in Yandex.Practicum and working with technologies like Django, Django Rest Framework, Docker, Nginx, and databases like PostgreSQL and SQLite. I also use GitHub to collaborate on projects and learn from others. I'm always looking to improve my skills and contribute to meaningful projects in the backend development space.

* I'm really love design and beauty.
